    <p>We’ve been asked what we’d like for a gift and the answer is simple: you, at our wedding, having a great time. But if you insist then we’ll say what we’d also love is the most amazing honeymoon. We are off to the Cook Islands for our honeymoon. We are planning to stay there for 10 days (5 nights in Rarotonga and then 4 nights in Aitutaki).</p>
    <p> During our honeymoon we plan on going on lagoon cruises, pamper treatments, quad bike adventures, kayaking, snorkelling and stand up paddle boarding and of course having some great cocktails and food. </p>
