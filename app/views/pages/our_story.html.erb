          <time>28 November 2013</time> Iain asked Tania out. He set the first date to be at One Red Dog so Tania waited there for him. Unfortunately Iain got muddled up with restaurant names and meant Big Dogs on Blair. They were both sitting at different restaurants waiting for each other until Iain told Tania he meant the date to be at Big Dogs.
